#Graph Class
#Ways to Store data
    #Nodey Graph
    #List of nodes
    #Each node has adjacent inside and data inside

    #Classy Graph
    #List of Adjacencys (Either Bags, or adjacency Matrix)
    #Parallel List of data

    #Edgey Graph
    #Bag of Edges (Either an array of bags for each vertex, or 1 big one)
    #Parallel List of data

#Number Of Nodes and Edges, (ARRAY with linked lists of ajdacencys?)
#Methods:
#Add Edge(Edge)
#AdjacentTo(Vertex)
#Edges #Iterable of all edges
#Get Edge(Source, Target)
#show Picture/Visualisz
    # Drag, Snap Grid
#Does Vertex Exist
#Does edge Exist
#Search
#DFS, BFS, Dikstra, Belman-Ford, Flloyd-Wawrshawl
   #Shortest Edges, Shortest Weight
        #Steps, Retrace Path
#Detect Cycle
#Detect Negative
#Detect Negative Cycle
#Topoligical Sort
#Is Tree, Is (Other Specific Graph thing)
#Add Or Remove

#Tree Things

#Vertice Class
#Vertices IDs, Data, and list of Edges

#Edge Class
#Assume, Edges are Directed, and Weighted, Most Resctrictive
#From, To, ToString


#THings that will help
#Linked List
#Heap
#Both are actually Graphs as Well




#UI
#Click to Make Vertex
#Click Edges to add Weights
#Add name to vertex and Edges
#type on keyboard to select something, kind of like in desktop
#Visualize and lightup algorithm paths
